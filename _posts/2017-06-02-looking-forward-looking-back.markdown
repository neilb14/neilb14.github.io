When we look forward, we often long for material things. A bigger house, a nicer car, or a shiny watch.  We visualize ourselves looking better, being more fashionable, trendy in the future. We see ourselves with the perfect partner. We think our happiness in the future resides on material or extrinsic gains.

But nobody says, "I wish I had a nicer car 5 years ago".

Instead our hindsight is largely based on character and relationships. We can think of moments where we wish we were more patient, more courageous or exercised greater compassion. We recall moments with other people and how they pushed us to feel, laugh and think. We appreciate the struggle of not having a nicer car 5 years ago because of what it taught and turned us into today.
