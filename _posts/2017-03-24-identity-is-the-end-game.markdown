When you start a new habit you begin by doing something new or different.

If you want to take up running you wake up early and tell yourself “I’ve got to go for a run”.

It’s a struggle. And takes a great deal of willpower. And you are pulled by the gravity of your old habits to fail.

Over time, you build up momentum in your change. You do it over, and over and over. Eventually you tell yourself “I get to go for a run”.

At some point the momentum becomes part of you. It forms your identity and you tell yourself “I am a runner”.
