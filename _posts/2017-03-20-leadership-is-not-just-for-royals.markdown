We typically think of leaders as those people in the highest positions. Kings looking down at their fiefdoms. That they control followers through authority.

But leaders are more often found among the people. Commoners who share their vision of a better life with others. They enroll followers through inspiration.

To be a leader you don't need to hold rank, get elected or have royal blood.

You do need to build participation by engaging the people around you to take action in your mission.
