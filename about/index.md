Hi. I'm Neil Bourgeois.

I love to solve hard problems. The hardest problems are plagued with uncertainty, risk and complexity. Solutions require that people work together towards a common vision. Usually they involve some degree of technology but they almost always require people to change.

This intersection of problem, people and technology is where I'm at my best.

I live and [work](http://gravityfree.ca/) in Edmonton, Canada. I went to school at [The University of Alberta](http://ualberta.ca/) ([COMPE &rsquo;02](http://http://ece.engineering.ualberta.ca/Undergraduate/ComputerEngineering.aspx)). I lead teams, craft solutions and I'm happiest when I'm coding.

I'm a relentless self-developer and pursue mastery of my craft. While I spend a great deal of my time working with people I also usually have some kind of side-project I'm hacking on. I approach problems with a people-first perspective and believe that sometimes the simplest (but not easiest!) solution is to change hearts and minds.
